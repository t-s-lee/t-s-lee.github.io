I am a scientist with a background in synthetic chemistry, photophysics, quantum mechanical modeling, machine learning, and software development. My interdisciplinary experience was forged from a problem-oriented approach to science. Whether in the lab or on my computer I love breaking down challenging problems, developing useful applications of new technology, and understanding the underlying mechanisms driving complex systems. 

Areas of Expertise
======
### Machine Learning & Drug Development
My research in this area seeks to tackle challenging problems in drug development using machine learning, automation, physical modeling, and iterative design. Subjects of current interest include: Bayesian chemical structure optimization, molecular representation learning, and automated virtual screening.

### Organometallic Photophysics & Spectroscopy
Transition metal complexes play critical roles as photocatalysts for solar-to-electrical energy conversion and chemical synthesis. My research in this area utilizes organometallic chemistry, quantum mechanical modeling, and ultrafast spectroscopy to understand and improve photocatalytic systems.

### Synthetic Photochemistry & Methods Development
Photochemistry utilizes energy in the form of light to drive unique and otherwise unfavorable chemical reactions. The objective of this work is to develop broadly useful photosynthetic methods for small molecule synthesis.
