I am a Ph.D. chemist aspiring to become a USPTO patent agent. 

In my scientific career, I have cultivated expertise at the interface of chemistry, physics, and engineering. In particular, during my graduate and postdoctoral studies, I engaged in broad and collaborative research with scientists from diverse backgrounds spanning organic chemistry, functional materials, and electrical engineering. In addition, I have paid particular attention to scientific communication including authoring peer reviewed articles, writing grant applications, and editing/reviewing the work of other scientists.

Aside from research, I am a passionate educator. As a Ph.D. and postdoctoral researcher, I mentored graduate and undergraduate students in both science and effective scientific communication.
