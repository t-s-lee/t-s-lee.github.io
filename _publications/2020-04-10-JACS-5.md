Methylation of organohalides represents a valuable transformation, but typically requires harsh reaction conditions or
reagents. We report a radical approach for the methylation of (hetero)aryl chlorides using nickel/photoredox catalysis wherein trimethyl orthoformate, a common laboratory solvent, serves as a methyl source. This method permits methylation of (hetero)aryl chlorides and acyl chlorides at an early and late stage with broad functional group compatibility. Mechanistic investigations indicate that trimethyl orthoformate serves as a source of methyl radical via β-scission from a tertiary radical generated upon chlorine-mediated hydrogen atom transfer.
