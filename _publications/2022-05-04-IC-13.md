Photoluminescent molecules exploiting the sizable spin–orbit coupling constants of main group metals and metalloids to access long-lived triplet excited states are relatively rare compared to phosphorescent transition metal complexes. Here we report the synthesis of three air- and moisture-stable group 14 compounds E(MePDPPh)2, where E = Si, Ge, or Sn and [MePDPPh]2– is the doubly deprotonated form of 2,6-bis(5-methyl-3-phenyl-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyridine. In solution, all three molecules exhibit exceptionally long-lived triplet excited states with lifetimes in the millisecond range and show highly efficient photoluminescence (Φ ≤ 0.49) due to competing prompt fluorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence at and around room temperature. Temperature-dependent steady-state emission spectra and photoluminescent lifetime measurements provided conclusive evidence for the two distinct emission pathways. Picosecond transient absorption spectroscopy allowed further analysis of the intersystem crossing (ISC) between singlet and triplet manifolds (τISC = 0.25–3.1 ns) and confirmed the expected trend of increased ISC rates for the heavier elements in otherwise isostructural compounds.
